---- config
It seems the script inside /Applications/ffmpegX.app/Contents/Resources/flvtool2
points to
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby
while on my system (10.4.11), and maybe yours as well, it should point to
/usr/bin/ruby
because that's where ruby resides on my system.
You can edit that in any text editor. (I did it with BBEdit.) The "bad interpreter: No such file or directory"-error no longer appears in the log. This fixes the metadata being correctly added to the .flv file.
With the wrong path in the script, you should get a valid .flv file without the metadata, just like the previous version of ffmpegX.
